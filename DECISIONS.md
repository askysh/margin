# Decisions

Product and technical decisions made without asking. Each one lists the options and the pick.

## D1. Product name: "Margin"
- Options: reuse "Minutes" (it confuses the two apps, and both are installed side by side),
  "Margin", "Notch", "Scribe".
- Pick: **Margin**, for notes in the margin of a meeting. Bundle ID
  `com.akashmishra.margin`, following benchbar's `com.akashmishra.benchbar`. It is easy to
  rename before the first release.

## D2. Shell: Tauri v2 + React + TypeScript (Vite)
- See RESEARCH.md §2.

## D3. Isolate our state from the upstream Minutes.app
- Context: upstream Minutes.app is installed and running on this Mac. It owns `~/.minutes`
  and `~/.config/minutes`.
- Options:
  - (a) Share them. Both apps then fight over `recording.pid`, a `minutes stop` from either
    one stops both, and our Reset would wipe its config.
  - (b) Isolate with `MINUTES_CONFIG_PATH` and `MINUTES_DATA_DIR`.
- Pick: **(b)**. Config is `~/Library/Application Support/Margin/config.toml`, and state
  goes in `~/Library/Application Support/Margin/state/`.
- Exception: `voices.db` is hardcoded to `~/.minutes`, so it is shared.
  See UPSTREAM-PATCHES.md #1.
- Cost: MCP and the `minutes` CLI do not see our state by default. Settings shows the
  `MEETINGS_DIR` snippet that makes MCP read our meetings.

## D4. Output folder is written to directly (no vault symlink/copy)
- Default `~/Documents/Meetings`. The user can pick any folder, such as a subfolder of an
  Obsidian vault or of iCloud Drive.
- We leave `[vault]` disabled. That removes upstream's symlink/copy setup, which is the
  file-management pain point.

## D5. System audio via Core Audio process tap (not ScreenCaptureKit)
- The core tap needs macOS **14.4+** and the "System Audio Recording" permission, not
  Screen Recording.
- The brief says to request screen recording, but the tap does not need it. We ask only
  for what we use, and say why.

## D6. Summaries default to None
- We always write `summarization.engine` explicitly, because a missing key means `auto`,
  which silently runs `claude -p`.
- The choices are None, Claude CLI (`agent` engine with the claude command) and Ollama.

## D7. Speaker rename rewrites the Markdown
- Upstream stores renames only as overlay rows bound to the file's hash, which any later
  edit invalidates.
- We rewrite the transcript labels and `speaker_map` in the file so Obsidian shows names.
  Then we write the overlay row against the new bytes, and save a voice sample so the
  person is recognised next time.

## D8. Live "You / Them" labels are a host-side heuristic
- Upstream live lines have no speaker.
- In call mode we compare the RMS of the `.voice.wav` and `.system.wav` windows for each
  line. The UI shows these labels as approximate. Proper diarized labels replace them
  after processing.
